                    College students need an app that simplifies the budgeting process and helps them make logical investments and optimize their money management.

                <p>
                   I worked together with my group to compile a list of a lot of the factors that could be considered when creating the app. We explored who the app would meant for, potential classifications for the budgeting, external actions that would have to be considered and ways that the budgeting could be computed.
